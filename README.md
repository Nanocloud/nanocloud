[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Nanocloud/nanocloud.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Nanocloud/nanocloud) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/Nanocloud/nanocloud/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/Nanocloud/nanocloud)

**Next version of Nanocloud is still in heavy develoment**

# Run

Nanocloud relies on Docker containers to run its stack.

````
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
````

Some environment variable are expected to be set in `config.env`:
- IAAS (mandatory) currently "manual", "openstack" and "aws" are implemented
- HOST (mandatory, defaults to localhost) nanocloud's host
- SMTP_SERVER_HOST host to send email
- SMTP_SERVER_PORT (defaults to 25) port for the SMTP server
- SMTP_LOGIN login for the SMTP server
- SMTP_PASSWORD password for the SMTP server
- SMTP_SEND_FROM (defaults to mail@nanocloud.com) nanocloud's sender

Manual driver specific:
- MACHINES (array) Array of machine object to statically insert in the database

AWS driver specific
- AWS_REGION region where machines will appear
- AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID KeyId
- AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY Private key
- AWS_KEY_NAME Private key name
- AWS_PRIVATE_KEY (defaults to /tmp/id_rsa) path to where the key will be stored
- AWS_IMAGE (defaults to ami-09e61366, Nanocloud default image)
- AWS_FLAVOR (defaults to t2.medium) size of the virtual machine
- AWS_MACHINE_USERNAME (defaults to Administrator) administrator account on the machine

Openstack driver specific
 - OPENSTACK_USERNAME Openstack username
 - OPENSTACK_PASSWORD Openstack password
 - OPENSTACK_AUTH_URL Openstack auth URL without version
 - OPENSTACK_REGION (Defaults to 'RegionOne') Openstack region name
 - OPENSTACK_IMAGE image to boot Windows execution servers from
 - OPENSTACK_FLAVOR (defaults to m1.medium) type id of the virtual machine
 - OPENSTACK_SECURITY_GROUPS (Defaults to default) security groups to apply to the instance, should be an array
 - OPENSTACK_MACHINE_USERNAME (Defaults to Administrator) Windows account username
 - OPENSTACK_MACHINE_PASSWORD (Defaults password will be generated) Windows account password

Storage specific:

# Run in developer mode

Nanocloud also relies on Docker to run its development stack:

````
docker-compose build
docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml build
docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up
````

Backend and frontend containers are automatically updated when source code changes in dev mode.
All services are accessible on localhost.

# Tests

To run all tests:

````
make tests
````

This will run all tests defined in `./tests/test-all.sh`.

Alternativelly, tests can be run individually:

- `make test-api` to test the API
- `make test-jshint` to analyse code for errors and warnings

Some environment variables can be set to customize tests:
- TEST_MAIL (boolean, defaults to false) load stub email transporter for testing purpose

**API tests expects a postgres database up and running on localhost**
