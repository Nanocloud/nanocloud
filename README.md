# Nanocloud

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Nanocloud/nanocloud.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Nanocloud/nanocloud) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/Nanocloud/nanocloud/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/Nanocloud/nanocloud)

**Next version of Nanocloud is still in heavy develoment**

# Run

Nanocloud relies on Docker containers to run its stack.

````
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
````

Some environment variable are expected to be set in `config.env`:
- IAAS (mandatory) currently only "manual" in implemented

Manual driver specific:
- EXECUTION_SERVERS (mandatory) the IP of the execution server
- WINDOWS_PASSWORD (mandatory) the Windows password for the *administrator* account

Once loaded, Nanocloud will be accessible on **localhost**.

# Run in developer mode

Nanocloud also relies on Docker to run its development stack:

````
docker-compose build
docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml build
docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up
````

Backend and frontend containers are automatically updated when source code changes in dev mode.
All services are accessible on localhost.

# Tests

To run all tests:

````
make tests
````

This will run all tests defined in `./tests/test-all.sh`.

Alternativelly, tests can be run individually:

- `make test-api` to test the API
- `make test-jshint` to analyse code for errors and warnings

**API tests expects a postgres database up and running on localhost**
